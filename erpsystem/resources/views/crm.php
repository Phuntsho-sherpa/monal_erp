        <h3><span class="typcn typcn-device-desktop icon"></span>Our Process</h3>
        <p>The CRM process involves several stages, which can vary depending on the specific needs and goals of a business.
           Generally, the process includes the following stages:<br>

1.Data collection: The first stage of the CRM process involves collecting data on customers, 
such as their contact information, purchase history, and preferences. This data can be collected through 
various channels, such as online forms, surveys, and social media.<br>

2.Data analysis: Once the data is collected, the next stage involves analyzing it to gain insights 
into customer behavior and preferences. This can be done using data mining and analysis tools, which can
 identify patterns and trends in the data.<br>

3.Customer segmentation: Based on the insights gained from the data analysis, businesses can segment their 
customers into different groups based on their needs and behaviors. This allows them to personalize their marketing 
and sales efforts to each segment.<br>
