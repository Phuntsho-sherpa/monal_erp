        <p>A point of sale (POS) refers to the location where a transaction takes place between a buyer and a seller, usually in a retail or hospitality setting. It can also refer to the software and hardware used to manage the transaction and record the sale.
  In a retail environment, the point of sale typically includes a cash register, barcode scanner, credit card terminal, and receipt printer. In a restaurant or hospitality setting, the POS may include features such as table management, menu ordering, and inventory management.</p>
