        <p>Asset management refers to the process of managing an organization's assets, which
           can include physical assets such as equipment and property, as well as financial assets

          <p>    1.Asset Inventory: The first step in asset management is to conduct a comprehensive inventory of all the assets owned by the organization, including their location, condition, and value.<br>
  
  2.Asset Tracking: Once the inventory is complete, assets must be tracked over time to monitor changes in their condition and value, as well as their utilization and performance.<br>
  
  3.Asset Maintenance: Regular maintenance is critical to keeping assets in good condition and maximizing their useful life. Asset management involves developing and implementing a maintenance program to ensure that assets are inspected, serviced, and repaired as needed.<br>
  
  4.Asset Depreciation: Assets lose value over time due to wear and tear, obsolescence, and other factors. Asset management involves tracking the depreciation of assets and accounting for this in financial statements and tax filings.<br>
  
  5.Asset Replacement and Disposal: Eventually, assets will need to be replaced or disposed of. Asset management involves developing a plan for replacing assets as needed, as well as disposing of assets that are no longer useful or valuable.<br>
  
  6.Asset Performance Monitoring: Asset management also involves monitoring the performance of assets to ensure that they are meeting their intended purpose and delivering value to the organization. This may involve analyzing data on asset utilization, downtime, and other metrics to identify opportunities for improvement.</p>
